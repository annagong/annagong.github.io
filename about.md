## Hi, my name is Anna!
I'm a 17-year-old art student in Southern California. I make a lot of work in a variety of mediums, including both digital and traditional art. My primary focus right now is improving my style, technique, and vision. If you're interested in a commission of any kind, email me at **agong1@hwemail.com**.
### Thanks for stopping by!
