## Hi, ![girl](https://annagong.github.io/girl.png){:style="float: right;margin-right: 10px;margin-left: 5px;margin-top: 0px;"}
my name is Anna! I'm a 17-year-old art student in Southern California. I make a lot of work in a variety of mediums, including both digital and traditional art. My primary focus right now is improving my style, technique, and vision. If you're interested in a commission of any kind, email me at **agong1@hwemail.com**.
### Thanks for stopping by!
